- *bin*: The output executables go here, both for the app and for any
  tests and spikes.
- *build*: This folder contains all object files, and is removed on a
  =clean=.
- *doc*: Any notes, like my assembly notes and configuration files, are
  here. I decided to create the development and production config files
  in here instead of in a separate =config= folder as they “document”
  the configuration.
- *include*: All project header files. All necessary third-party header
  files that do not exist under =/usr/local/include= are also placed
  here.
- *lib*: Any libs that get compiled by the project, third party or any
  needed in development. Prior to deployment, third party libraries get
  moved to =/usr/local/lib= where they belong, leaving the project
  clean enough to compile on our Linux deployment servers. I really use
  this to test different library versions than the standard.
- *src*: The application and only the application's source files.
- *test*: All test code files. You do write tests, no?
- *electronic*: All the hardware boards and related
- *pictures* project photos
- *root* configuration files that can be copied to "/" on BBB
